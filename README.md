# Prime-Table

----------------------HOW TO RUN----------------------

1.Open the index.html from the folder.

2.Choose the algorithm you would like to use and the function you would like to use.

3.Enter the maximum number you would like to use.

4.A window will pop up stating the run time for the generating primes(in milliseconds).

5.The output will be displayed underneath.

More Info


Creating the primetable will show a table with the x and y axes and the two axes multiplied in the cells.

Generating primes will display a list of every prime from 2 -> n(user inputted value).

You will have to wait a while for the larger inputs as the printing method is very slow, however the alert window will tell you how 
long it took to actually run through all the primes, it's just the print bottlenecks the performance.


----------------------What I'm pleased with----------------------

I'm happy with the complexity of the algorithms, as they both calculate up to a million primes very fast. I'm also happy with the
display and formatting of the table and also design of the site. The code is also commented and easy to understand for the most part,
it is also quite easy to change and refactor. I'm quite happy with my own algorithm as it is quite fast but not as fast as the Eratosthenes
which I also interpreted to javascript myself.


----------------------What I'd like to do if I had more time----------------------

If I had more time, I would have liked to have it run much faster as the print method is very slow and can timeout. Also, the print
isn't very well optimised and uses a lot of memory, so I would have liked to improve that. Also, I would have liked to make it so the 
user can ask for the primes between to values as this could have been a useful feature. I would have also like to do more error testing 
on this page to try multiple scenarios.
